There is an open discussion as to whether a generalist is better than a specialist, or the other way around. You can weigh in the pros and cons but it always falls back to the situation when one can be more efficient than the other. My end goal has always been <a href=\"/blog/everyday-is-a-starting-point\">being both</a>. Rolling eyes aside, it can be done. How? Being able to switch between seeing things in micro versus macro.
