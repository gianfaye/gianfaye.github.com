JAM stands for JavaScript, APIs, Markups. It is when you can build everything in JavaScript, server-side processes are abstracted into microservice APIs, and the Markup is pre-built using a static site generator. On a traditional web development project cycle, the frontend has always been stacked after UI prototyping and before backend development. But with the JAMstack, the need to manage and run web servers is entirely eliminated.
