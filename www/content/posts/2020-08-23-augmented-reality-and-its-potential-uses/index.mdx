**Augmented reality (AR)** is a technology that **enhances** or **modifies** a user's perception of the real world by superimposing digital content on top of it. This digital content can take the form of text, photos, audio, or video, and it can be viewed on a range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and specialized glasses.

AR is distinct from **Virtual Reality (VR),** a technology that provides a fully immersive digital environment that **replaces** the user's experience of the actual world. While VR typically requires the use of specialized equipment, such as a headset, AR may be accessed via a number of devices and does not demand the user being totally immersed in a digital environment. AR and VR are part of a superset called **Extended Reality (ER)**.

AR technology has numerous applications, including entertainment, education, and industry. AR games and applications, for example, can give an engaging and immersive experience, whereas AR tools can be used to visualize and engage with 3D models or simulations in sectors like as architecture, engineering, and medical. üì≤

Here are **20 potential use cases for augmented reality (AR)** in the modern world:

## #1. Gaming

AR games and apps provide an interactive and immersive experience for users. There are already a variety of AR games available, ranging from simple mobile games to more complex console and PC games. Some examples of AR games include:
* **Pok√©mon Go**: This popular mobile game employs augmented reality (AR) technology to allow users to capture virtual Pok√©mon in the real world using their smartphone camera and GPS. You may have heard about it or even played it in person. When this game was released in the 1990s, many kids were excited (and probably hooked).
* **Ingress**: This smartphone game utilizes augmented reality to create a multiplayer experience in which players compete to control virtual portals in real-world locales. I played this back in 2016, long before AR became popular with the release of Pok√©mon Go, both of which were made by Niantic Labs. I've attended meetups with various factions and witnessed outrageously large multi-country portal connections.
* **The Room**: This mobile puzzle game incorporates augmented reality (AR) to allow players to control virtual objects in the real world in order to solve puzzles.
* **Minecraft Earth**: This smartphone game uses augmented reality to allow users to construct and explore virtual creations in the real world.
* **Ghost Recon: Wildlands**: This console and PC game utilizes augmented reality to enable players to interact with virtual items and characters in the real world.
