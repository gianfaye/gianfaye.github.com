**Augmented reality (AR)** is a technology that **enhances** or **modifies** a user's perception of the real world by superimposing digital content onto their view of the physical world. This digital content can include text, images, audio, or video, and it can be displayed on a variety of devices, such as smartphones, tablets, or specialized glasses.

AR differs from **Virtual Reality (VR)**, which is a technology that creates a completely immersive digital environment that **replaces** the user's perception of the physical world. While VR typically requires specialized equipment, such as a headset, AR can be accessed through a variety of devices and does not require the user to be fully immersed in a digital environment. Both AR and VR are part of a superset called **Extended Reality (ER)**.

AR technology can be used in a variety of applications, including entertainment, education, and industry. For example, AR games and apps can provide an interactive and immersive experience, while AR tools can be used in fields such as architecture, engineering, and medicine to visualize and interact with 3D models or simulations. üì≤

Here are **20 potential use cases for augmented reality (AR)** in the modern world:

## #1. Gaming

AR games and apps provide an interactive and immersive experience for users. There are already a variety of AR games available, ranging from simple mobile games to more complex console and PC games. Some examples of AR games include:
* **Pok√©mon Go**: This popular mobile game uses AR technology to allow players to catch virtual Pok√©mon in the real world using their smartphone camera and GPS. You might have heard about this or even played this IRL. Many 90's kids were enthusiastic (and probably hooked) when this game was launched.
* **Ingress**: This mobile game uses AR to create a multiplayer experience in which players battle to control virtual portals located in real-world locations. I've personally played this wayback 2016, even before AR boomed with the launch of Pok√©mon Go, which are both created by the developer Niantic Labs. I've joined meetups with different groups of people in different factions and saw ridiculously huge multi-country portal connections.
* **The Room**: This mobile puzzle game uses AR to allow players to manipulate virtual objects in the real world to solve puzzles.
* **Minecraft Earth**: This mobile game uses AR to allow players to build and explore virtual creations in the real world.
* **Ghost Recon: Wildlands**: This console and PC game uses AR to allow players to interact with virtual objects and characters in the real world.
