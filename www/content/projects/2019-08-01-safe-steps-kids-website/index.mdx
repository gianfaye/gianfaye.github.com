<hr />

**SAFE STEPS KIDS** is an initiative by Prudence Foundation, in partnership with Cartoon Network and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), that aims to education kids about safety instructions they can do when disasters strike, how they can apply first aid, and be aware about road safety.

## The Site
The website is mostly targeted for kids as well as their parents. It includes interactive, educational, and downloadable materials that bring awareness to kids in a fun way.

It features familiar characters from Cartoon Network such as **The Powerpuff Girls** for Disaster awareness, **We Bare Bears** for First Aid, and **The Amazing World of Gumball** for Road Safety awareness.

## The Outcome

Equipping children with the knowledge on these precautionary measures and what to do in times of crisis is equivalent to protecting them. Explore the website and share it to your kids!
